# Guess-the-word
This game is similar to the hangman game where a person is provided with a fixed number of chances. They have to guess a character and if that character is present in the randomly generated word, it'll print the character along with unfilled blanks on the screen. With each and every wrong guess, the player loses one chance. If all their chances get exhausted, they lose. Else, if they find the word successfully, they win!
